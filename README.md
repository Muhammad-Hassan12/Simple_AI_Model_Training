# Simple_AI_Model_Training
This is a complete step-by-step tutorial of Training a highly efficient "AI Model"!
## Preview
In this project I am going to train an "AI Model" to identify different kinds of "Flowers" using "sciket-learn"(Python's Advance Machine-Leaning Library)! The Data set I am using is "load_iris"!
This repository also includes the "Pre-trained Model" that I have trained during the project!
## Main File
The Main file in which I trained the model is "Simple AI Model Training.ipynb"!
## Trained Model
The product of the main file is this Pre-trained Model "Iris_classifier_knn.joblib"! This model (that I have trained) has the efficiency of "95.55%"!
## Disclaimer!
The efficiency of model varies from PC to PC and even after following the exact steps you may not get the same result! (You may get higher or lower effciency than the model I have showed you!)
